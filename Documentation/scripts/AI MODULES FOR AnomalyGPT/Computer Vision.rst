What is Computer Vision ?
----------------------------------


.. raw:: html

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is meaningful. NLP combines techniques from linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to process and analyze large volumes of natural language data. Common applications of NLP include text analysis, language translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and chatbot systems. By leveraging algorithms and models, NLP breaks down language into components like syntax (structure), semantics (meaning), and pragmatics (context) to enable machines to extract insights or generate coherent responses.
    </i></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    The core challenges of NLP lie in handling the ambiguity, complexity, and variability of human language. Words often have multiple meanings depending on context, and the same sentiment can be expressed in numerous ways. NLP techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and parsing, preprocess language data to make it usable for models. Modern advancements like deep learning have propelled NLP capabilities, with architectures like transformers enabling state-of-the-art performance in tasks like text summarization, question answering, and conversational AI. By bridging the gap between human communication and computer systems, NLP plays a vital role in creating intelligent and accessible technologies.

    <p><span style="color:rgb(41, 128, 185);"><b>1. Feature Extraction<b></span></p>

    Computer Vision in AnomalyGPT begins with extracting visual features from input images using the ImageBind-Huge model, a pre-trained image encoder.<br>
    How it Works: <br>
    The image encoder processes high-resolution industrial images, converting them into hierarchical feature representations (Fimg).<br>
    These features capture important details such as textures, shapes, and patterns that are critical for identifying anomalies.<br>
    Example : 
    Input: An image of a screw.<br>
    Output: A feature map highlighting the physical characteristics of the screw, such as threads, length, and surface texture.<br>
    <p><span style="color:white;">'</p></span>

    <p><span style="color:rgb(41, 128, 185);"><b>2. Pixel-Level Anomaly Localization<b></span></p>

    The Feature-Matching Decoder, a key Computer Vision module, uses extracted features to identify and localize anomalies at the pixel level.<br>
    How it Works:<br>
    The decoder compares patch-level features of the input image with a memory bank of normal reference features.<br>
    Areas in the input image that deviate significantly from the reference are marked as anomalous.<br>
    Localization maps are generated, highlighting specific regions with anomalies.<br>
    Example:<br>
    Input: An image of a metallic panel with scratches.<br>
    Output: A heatmap overlay on the image, highlighting the scratched regions for further inspection.<br>
    <p><span style="color:white;">'</p></span>

    <p><span style="color:rgb(41, 128, 185);"><b>3. Few-Shot Learning<b></span></p>

    How it Works:<br>
    During inference, the system matches query images against a few stored normal samples.<br>
    Deviations from these references are identified as potential anomalies.<br>
    Example:<br>
    Reference Image: A normal cable.<br>
    Query Image: A frayed cable.<br>
    Output: Detection of the frayed section, with a heatmap showing its location.<br>
    <p><span style="color:white;">'</p></span>

    <p><span style="color:rgb(41, 128, 185);"><b>4. Integration with Vision-Language Models<b></span></p>

    Computer Vision bridges the gap between visual data and the Natural Language Processing (NLP) module by generating intermediate outputs that can be aligned with textual prompts.<br>
    How it Works:<br>
    Visual outputs, such as localization maps and segmentation results, are transformed into embeddings by the Prompt Learner.<br>
    These embeddings are aligned with textual inputs for meaningful responses.<br>
    Example:<br>
    Visual Input: A segmented image showing missing threads on a screw.<br>
    NLP Response: "The anomaly is located near the middle threads of the screw."<br>
    <p><span style="color:white;">'</p></span>

    <p><span style="color:rgb(41, 128, 185);"><b>5. Data Augmentation and Synthetic Anomaly Simulation<b></span></p>

    How it Works:<br>
    Synthetic anomalies are generated using techniques such as Cut-Paste and Poisson Editing, which simulate real-world defects like scratches, dents, or missing components.<br>
    These augmented datasets help the model generalize better to unseen anomalies.<br>
    Example:<br>
    Augmented Image: A simulated defect on a metallic panel (e.g., a scratch added using Poisson Editing).<br>
    Output: The system detects and localizes the synthetic anomaly during testing.<br>
    <p><span style="color:white;">'</p></span>

    <p><span style="color:rgb(41, 128, 185);"><b>6. Multi-Modal Interaction<b></span></p>

    How it Works:<br>
    After generating localization maps, the visual outputs are paired with text-based user queries.<br>
    For example, the system combines a heatmap with a textual explanation, making the results more actionable.<br>
    Example:<br>
    User Query: "What is wrong with this component?"<br>
    Visual Output: A heatmap showing a crack in the upper-right corner.<br>
    Textual Output: "There is a crack in the upper-right corner of the component."<br>

1. Introduction
_________________________

.. raw:: html

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>

    Most object detection models are trained to identify a narrow predetermined collection of classes. The main problem with this is the lack of flexibility. Every time you want to expand or change the set of recognizable objects, you have to collect data, label it, and train the model again. This — of course — is  time-consuming and expensive.
   </i></span></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>

    Zero-shot detectors want to break this status quo by making it possible to detect new objects without re-training a model. All you have to do is change the prompt and the model will detect the objects you describe.
   </i></span></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>

    Below we see two images visualizing predictions made with</span><span style="color:red;"><strong> Grounding DINO</span></strong><span style="color:#000080;"> — the new SOTA zero-shot object detection model.
   </i></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>

    In the case of the images below, we asked the model to identify the class <strong>" '</span><span style="color:red;">piano</span><span style="color:#000080;">', '</span><span style="color:red;">guitar</span><span style="color:#000080;">','</span><span style="color:red;">phone</span><span style="color:#000080;">','</span><span style="color:red;">hat</span><span style="color:#000080;">' "</span></strong> <span style="color:#000080;"> a class belonging to the COCO dataset. The model successfully detected all objects of this class without any issues.
   </i></span></p>

    <p><span style="color:white;">'</p></span>

   <strong> text prompt :</strong>['<span style="color:blue;">piano</span>', '<span style="color:blue;">guitar</span>', '<span style="color:blue;">phone</span>', '<span style="color:blue;">hat</span>']

3. Advantages of Grounding DINO
________________________________


.. raw:: html

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    Zero-Shot Object Detection — Grounding DINO excels at detecting objects even when they are not part of the predefined set of classes in the training data. This unique capability enables the model to adapt to novel objects and scenarios, making it highly versatile and applicable to various real-world tasks.
    </p></span></i>    
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) — Identifying and localizing a specific object or region within an image is based on a given textual description. In other words, instead of detecting people and chairs in an image and then writing custom logic to determine whether a chair is occupied, prompt engineering can be used to ask the model to detect only those chairs where a person is sitting. This requires the model to possess a deep understanding of both the language and the visual content, as well as the ability to associate words or phrases with corresponding visual elements.
    </p></span></i>    
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    Elimination of Hand-Designed Components like NMS — Grounding DINO simplifies the object detection pipeline by removing the need for hand-designed components, such as Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). This streamlines the model architecture and training process while improving efficiency and performance.
    </p></span></i>

4. Grounding DINO Architecture
________________________________



.. raw:: html

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>Model architecture</strong></span></p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>

    Grounding DINO aims to merge concepts found in the </span><span style="color:blue;">DINO</span><span style="color:#000080;"> and </span><span style="color:blue;">GLIP</span><span style="color:#000080;"> papers. DINO, a transformer-based detection method, </span><span style="color:blue;">offers state-of-the-art object detection performance</span><span style="color:#000080;"> and end-to-end optimization, eliminating the need for handcrafted modules like NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression).
    </p></span></i>    
  
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    On the other hand, GLIP focuses on </span><span style="color:blue;">phrase grounding.</span><span style="color:#000080;"> This task involves associating phrases or words from a given text with corresponding visual elements in an image or video, effectively linking textual descriptions to their respective visual representations.
    </p></span></i>    


    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:blue;"><i>
    Text backbone and Image backbone </span><span style="color:#000080;"> — Multiscale image features are extracted using an image backbone like Swin Transformer, and text features are extracted with a text backbone like BERT.
    </p></span></i> 

.. figure:: /Documentation/images/foundation-models/grounding-DINO/10.webp

.. raw:: html


    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>

    The output of these two streams are fed into a feature enhancer for transforming the two sets of features into a single unified representation space. The feature enhancer includes multiple feature enhancer layers. Deformable self-attention is utilized to enhance image features, and regular self-attention is used for text feature enhancers.
    </p></span></i>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>

   Grounding DINO aims to detect objects from an image specified by an input text. In order to effectively leverage the input text for object detection, a language-guided query selection is used to select most relevant features from both the image and text inputs. These queries guide the decoder in identifying the locations of objects in the image and assigning them appropriate labels based on the text descriptions.
   </p></span></i>    


.. figure:: /Documentation/images/foundation-models/grounding-DINO/8.webp
   :width: 700
   :align: center
   :alt: Alternative text for the image


.. raw:: html

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>

    A cross-modality decoder is then used to integrate text and image modality features. The cross-modality decoder operates by processing the fused features and decoder queries through a series of attention layers and feed-forward networks. These layers allow the decoder to effectively capture the relationships between the visual and textual information, enabling it to refine the object detections and assign appropriate labels. After this step, the model proceedes with the final steps in the object detection including bounding box prediction, class specific confidence filtering and label assignment.
   </p></span></i> 

    <p><span style="color:white;">'</p></span>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>How it works?</strong></span></p>

Here is how Grounding DINO would work on this image:


.. figure:: /Documentation/images/foundation-models/grounding-DINO/8.webp
   :width: 700
   :align: center
   :alt: Alternative text for the image


.. raw:: html


    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    The model will first use its understanding of language to identify the objects that are mentioned in the text prompt. For example, in the description “two dogs with a stick,” the model would identify the words “dogs” and “stick” as objects
   </p></span></i>  

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    The model will then generate a set of object proposals for each object that was identified in the natural language description. The object proposals are generated using a variety of features such as the color, shape, and texture of the objects
   </p></span></i>  

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    Next, the score for each object proposal is returned by the model. The score is a measure of how likely it is that the object proposal contains an actual object
   </p></span></i>  

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    The model would then select the top-scoring object proposals as the final detections. The final detections are the objects that the model is most confident are present in the image
   </p></span></i>  

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    In this case, the model would likely detect the two dogs and the stick in the image. The model would also likely score the two dogs higher than the stick, because the dogs are larger and more prominent in the image.
   </p></span></i>

2. What is the Segment Anything Model?
_______________________________________
.. raw:: html

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>

    SAM is designed to revolutionize the way we approach image analysis by providing a versatile and adaptable</span><span style="color:red;"> foundation model </span><span style="color:#000080;">for segmenting objects and regions within images. 
    </p></span></i>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>

    Unlike traditional </span><span style="color:red;">image segmentation </span><span style="color:#000080;">models that require extensive task-specific modeling expertise, SAM eliminates the need for such specialization. Its primary objective is to simplify the segmentation process by serving as a foundational model that can be prompted with various inputs, including clicks, boxes, or text, making it accessible to a broader range of users and applications.

    How these components interact with each other is equally vital for effective image segmentation as their capabilities: 
    </p></span></i>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    
    The image encoder first creates a detailed understanding of the entire image, breaking it down into features that the engine can analyze. 
    </p></span></i>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    
    The prompt encoder then adds context, focusing the model’s attention based on the provided input, whether a simple point or a complex text description. 
     </p></span></i>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
   
    Finally, the mask decoder uses this combined information to segment the image accurately, ensuring that the output aligns with the input prompt’s intent.
