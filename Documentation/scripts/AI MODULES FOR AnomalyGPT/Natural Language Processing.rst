What is Natural Language Processing ?
----------------------------------


.. raw:: html

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is meaningful. NLP combines techniques from linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to process and analyze large volumes of natural language data. Common applications of NLP include text analysis, language translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and chatbot systems. By leveraging algorithms and models, NLP breaks down language into components like syntax (structure), semantics (meaning), and pragmatics (context) to enable machines to extract insights or generate coherent responses.
    </i></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    The core challenges of NLP lie in handling the ambiguity, complexity, and variability of human language. Words often have multiple meanings depending on context, and the same sentiment can be expressed in numerous ways. NLP techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and parsing, preprocess language data to make it usable for models. Modern advancements like deep learning have propelled NLP capabilities, with architectures like transformers enabling state-of-the-art performance in tasks like text summarization, question answering, and conversational AI. By bridging the gap between human communication and computer systems, NLP plays a vital role in creating intelligent and accessible technologies.

Roles in Project

    <p><span style="color:rgb(41, 128, 185);"><b>1. Understanding User Queries :<b></span></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><i>
    How it Works: <br>
    User input (e.g., "Is there an anomaly in this image?") is tokenized and converted into embeddings using the Vicuna-7B large language model (LLM).<br>
    These embeddings are aligned with visual embeddings generated from the Feature-Matching Decoder, ensuring the model understands the query in the context of the visual data.<br>
    Example : 
    Input:"What anomalies can you see in this industrial part?"<br>
    NLP interprets the question, retrieves relevant visual information, and processes it to generate a meaningful response.<br>
    <p><span style="color:rgb(41, 128, 185);"><b>2. Generating Explanatory Responses :<b></span></p>
    How it Works:<br>
    Anomaly localization results from the visual pipeline are converted into prompt embeddings by the Prompt Learner.<br>
    The Vicuna-7B LLM processes these embeddings to generate human-like responses, ensuring the output is understandable and actionable.<br>
    Example:<br>
    Visual Input: An image of a screw with missing threads.<br>
    User Query: "Describe the anomaly."<br>
    Output: "The screw has missing threads near the middle section, which could impact its functionality."<br>
    3. Facilitating Multi-Turn Dialogue<br>
    How it Works:<br>
    The model maintains a contextual understanding of previous queries and responses using the LLMâ€™s capabilities.<br>
    Users can ask follow-up questions, and NLP ensures the system provides consistent and context-aware answers.<br>
    Example:<br>
    User: "What is wrong with this image?"<br>
    System: "The metallic surface has a dent in the upper-left corner."<br>
    User: "Can you highlight the location?"<br>
    System: "The dent is highlighted in the following heatmap." (Heatmap provided alongside response)<br>
    4. Aligning Text and Vision Information<br>
    How it Works:<br>
    Localization outputs from the Feature-Matching Decoder are transformed into prompts by the Prompt Learner.<br>
    These prompts are designed to align with the textual processing capabilities of the Vicuna-7B LLM, ensuring seamless integration of text and visual data.<br>
    Example:<br>
    Localization Output: A segmentation map of a defective component.<br>
    NLP Task: Generate a descriptive text explaining the anomaly based on the segmentation map.<br>
    Output: "The highlighted region shows a crack extending diagonally across the lower-right corner."<br>

History of Foundation Models 
-----------------------------

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>

    The history of foundation models has witnessed significant milestones over the years. In the 1980s, the first models based on feedforward neural networks emerged, enabling the learning of simple patterns. The 1990s saw the development of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), capable of learning sequential patterns like text. Word embeddings, introduced in the 2000s, facilitated the understanding of semantic relationships between words. The 2010s brought attention to mechanisms, enhancing model performance by focusing on relevant parts of input data.

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><i>
    2018 marked two major breakthroughs: the introduction of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model, pre-trained on a vast text dataset, and the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, pre-trained on an extensive text and code dataset. In the 2020s, foundation models continued to advance rapidly, with the introduction of even larger and more powerful models surpassing GPT and BERT. These models achieved state-of-the-art results in various natural language processing tasks.
